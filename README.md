# CSC509-Project 5: Introduction to Git and Github
 
 Repository of solutions to array and list problems from various sources.
 
 ## Arrays and Loops
 
 Short introductory homework assignment that we performed on arrays and iterating over them.
 
 ## Coding Bat Problems
 
 All of the coding bat problems are located in a single playground file. They all come from the Array-1 problem set. These are primarily introductory problems of a low difficulty level.
 
 ## Project Euler Problems
 
 Each project Euler Problem is located in it's own playground file  labeled as projectEuler-problemX where X is the problem number. These problems are slightly more challenging than Coding Bat but not significantly more so.
 
 ## Collaborating Using Github
 I edited [Erik Fotta's code](https://github.com/erikfotta/Project-5-CSC509-Erik).
 The changes that I made include:
 
 - Coding Bat Problems
    - Problem 1: Edited comments for accuracy
    - Problem 2: Flipped the if else statement to check if even instead of checking if odd
 - Project 5 Question 1: Removed comment that was for Erik's benefit but didn't add anything to the reader's understanding of the code
 - ReadMe.md: Moved Erik's name from the top of the ReadMe.md file to the bottom
