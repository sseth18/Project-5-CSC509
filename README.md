# CSC509-Project 5: Introduction to Git and Github
 
 Repository of solutions to array and list problems from various sources.
 
 ## Arrays and Loops
 
 Short introuctory homework assignment that we performed on arrays and iterating over them.
 
 ## Coding Bat Problems
 
 All of the coding bat problems are located in a single playground file. They all come from the Array-1 problem set. These are primarily introductory problems of a low difficulty level.
 
 ## Project Euler Problems
 
 Each project Euler Problem is located in it's own playground file  labeled as projectEuler-problemX where X is the problem number. These problems are slightly more challenging than Coding Bat but not significantly more so.
